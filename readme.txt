This is my learning process of GIT, and the website I use for learning is shown above.

This is a second edition, and I will submit again.

This is the third change made on this file, also add a file named LICENSE.txt.

Want to track the changes made to this file.

Now I give an unadded change.

Now I am studying branch operation, test for new branch "dev".

This time I will test for a branch named feature1. Now I add a new line for master, conflict occurs, but solved now.

I am developing the project, being unaware of the bug.

Now, I know there is a bug commited in the master branch.
